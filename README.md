## 1 Linear Regression Model with Singel Variable

This notebook is designed to **predict house prices based on their areas** using a method called **linear regression**. It starts by importing the necessary libraries and loading a dataset that includes house areas and their prices. The data is cleaned by removing any rows with missing values. Then, it sets up a linear regression model, which is a simple way to find the relationship between two variables—in this case, the area of the house and its price. The model is trained using the existing data, and it then predicts prices for the given house areas. These predicted prices are added as a new column in the dataset. Finally, the actual and predicted prices are plotted on a graph to visually show how well the model's predictions match the real prices.

You can use this model for your practice and understanding by cloning the repositoy or downloading the model.


## 2 Linear Regression Model with Multiple Variables

This notebook is designed to **predict house prices based on multiple factors** using a method called **linear regression**. It starts by importing the necessary libraries and loading a dataset that includes house areas, number of bedrooms, age of the houses, and their prices. The data is cleaned by removing any rows with missing values. Then, it sets up a linear regression model, which is a method to find the relationship between multiple variables—in this case, the area of the house, number of bedrooms, age of the person, and its price. The model is trained using the existing data, and it then predicts prices based on other three variables. These predicted prices are added as a new column in the dataset. 

You can use this model for your practice and understanding by cloning the repositoy or downloading the model.
